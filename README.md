web-align
=========

A pairwise alignment applet using Javascript, Bootstrap and D3. It computes the edit distance of two strings
and outputs the whole DP matrix. Each matrix cell is clickable and shows the optimal alignment trace.

A live demo can be seen [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://raw.github.com/weese/web-align/master/index.html).

Currently, only edit distance is supported. Maybe I will add support for arbitrary costs and an SVG/PDF exporter.


Have fun!
