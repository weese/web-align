Pairwise Alignment Applet
=========================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A pairwise alignment applet using Javascript, Bootstrap and D3. It computes the edit distance of two strings
and outputs the whole DP matrix. Each matrix cell is clickable and shows the optimal alignment trace.

DEMO

For a live demo click [here](http://weese.github.io/web-align).


This is just a test of the D3 API. Currently, only edit distance is supported. Maybe I will add support for arbitrary costs and an SVG/PDF exporter.


Have fun!
